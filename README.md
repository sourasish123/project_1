# This is new project
In this project, I am using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, MySQL for database management, and Java & 
Python for backend development. Healthy Haven is a smart healthcare solution that helps users locate nearby hospitals 
efficiently, conveniently book doctor appointments for hassle-free medical care and check diseases for quick and informed 
medical assistance.
